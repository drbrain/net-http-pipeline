require 'net/http'

##
# An HTTP/1.1 pipelining implementation atop Net::HTTP.  This library is
# compliant with RFC 2616 8.1.2.2.
#
# Pipeline allows you to create a bunch of requests then send them all to an
# HTTP/1.1 server without waiting for responses.  The server will return HTTP
# responses in-order.
#
# Net::HTTP::Pipeline does not assume the server supports pipelining.  If you
# know the server supports pipelining you can set Net::HTTP#pipelining to
# true.
#
# = Example
#
#   require 'net/http/pipeline'
#
#   Net::HTTP.start 'example' do |http|
#     requests = []
#     requests << Net::HTTP::Get.new('/?response_body=a')
#     requests << Net::HTTP::Get.new('/?response_body=b')
#     requests << Net::HTTP::Get.new('/?response_body=c')
#
#     http.pipeline requests do |res|
#       puts res.code
#       puts res.body[0..60].inspect
#       puts
#     end
#   end
#
# Since pipelined requests must be return in submission order the responses
# will come in the same order as submission.  If http://example/ places the
# +response_body+ parameter in the body of the response this will print "a"
# then "b" then "c".
